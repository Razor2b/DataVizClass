This GitHub Repository has all the work I did for the Bootcamp I took at University of Richmond. 
I have opened it to the public for you to take a look around to see what I have learned. 
When you look first open this website you will see # folders. 
Each one of these folders are labled with the what the topic was for this assignment. 
I included the intructions and data for the assignent. 
I have put my answers in a folder that is labled "My Answer".
Feel free to click around.
